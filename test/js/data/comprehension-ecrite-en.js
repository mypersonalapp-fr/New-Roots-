// The Roots — Compréhension écrite (Anglais, niveau A1).
//
// Les 25 textes fournis par Ashley le 19/09 (voir claude/contenu-comprehension-
// ecrite-a1-textes.md dans le projet Claude), avec 2 questions à RÉPONSE
// LIBRE par texte (et non un QCM — précision d'Ashley le 19/09 au soir :
// elle veut que l'apprenant écrive sa propre réponse "avec sa main et sa
// puissance créative", pas choisir dans une phrase déjà construite).
//
// Correction du fond (précision d'Ashley le 19/09, message vocal) : à ce
// niveau, l'apprenant ne connaît que les mots déjà vus dans le texte qu'il
// est en train de lire — sa réponse va donc naturellement reprendre des mots
// de ce texte. Chaque question a :
// - "accepted" : quelques mots/expressions clés qu'on s'attend à voir tels
//   quels (correspondance directe, la plus fiable) ;
// - "answerSentence" : la phrase exacte du texte qui contient la réponse,
//   utilisée en secours (voir comprehension.js/contentMatches) — si la
//   réponse de l'apprenant partage au moins un mot important de cette
//   phrase, elle est acceptée, même si ce n'est pas un des mots-clés
//   pré-listés. Ça élargit beaucoup la tolérance sans avoir besoin d'une
//   vraie IA : l'apprenant ne peut de toute façon pas "inventer" un mot
//   qu'il n'a pas encore appris.
// La vérification orthographe/grammaire (LanguageTool) reste séparée, voir
// comprehension.js.
